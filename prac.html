            <h3>HOW OUR CLOTHES ARE ECO-FRIENDLY?</h3> 
        
            <p>As consumers, we can drive change in the fashion industry. We choose the clothes we buy and who we
                support with our money. We can create more awareness of the problems and make more responsible buying
                decisions.  
                Check out my article on how to help the fashion industry for tangible solutions to the disasters
                occurring daily to make clothes.
                Eco-friendly fashion doesn't harm the environment to some degree. It promotes a more ecological approach
                to fashion. It's similar to slow, green, and sustainable fashion. 
                Ethical, conscious, and fair fashion encourages a more socially responsible way of producing apparel and
                accessories. The goal is to avoid activities or organizations that harm people or the environment.</p>
